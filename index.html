<p>Hello There!
    This website is intended to show off crystal structures as well as the transition phases that occur between them<br>
    Heavy Work in Progress right now, but I'm figuring it out<br>
    To hold you over, here is some chemiscope for you to play around with (hopefully it works)
</p>

<checklist>
    Now for a bit of a checklist of things to do

    <ol>
        <li> Read through chemiscope and understand how it works</li>
        <li> Get some data to put on this website</li>
    </ol>
</checklist>
